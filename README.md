Here's a break down of the calculation of the total cost of the car in simpler terms:

# Base Cost Calculation:

The base cost of the car is determined based on the engine size selected by the user. 
For example: If the user selects a 4-cylinder engine, the base cost might be $20,000.
If the user selects a 6-cylinder engine, the base cost might be $25,000.
If the user selects an 8-cylinder engine, the base cost might be $30,000.

# Adjustments for Import Duty:

The base cost is adjusted based on the selected import duty location. Different countries might have different import duty rates. 
For example: If importing to the US, the base cost is increased by 10%.
If importing to Canada, the base cost is increased by 20%.
If importing to Mexico, the base cost is increased by 15%.

# Depreciation Adjustment:

The base cost is adjusted based on the age of the car, considering depreciation over time. The older the car, the lower its value due to wear and tear. 
For example: If the car is one year old, its value might decrease by 5%.
If the car is two years old, its value might decrease by an additional 5%.
This depreciation adjustment is calculated based on the current year and the year of manufacture.

# Facility Costs:

Additional costs are added for any optional facilities selected by the user, such as air conditioning or an open roof. 
For example: If the user selects air conditioning, an additional $1,000 might be added to the cost.
If the user selects an open roof, an additional $2,000 might be added to the cost.

# Make-Specific Adjustments:

Finally, there may be specific adjustments based on the make of the car. Different car manufacturers might have different pricing strategies or brand values that affect the cost. 
For example: Cars from certain manufacturers might have a higher resale value or perceived quality, leading to a price adjustment.
This adjustment is applied based on the selected make of the car.
Putting it all together, the total cost of the car is calculated by starting with the base cost, adjusting it for import duty, depreciation, optional facilities, and make-specific factors. Each factor contributes to the final cost based on the user's selections and the characteristics of the car.
